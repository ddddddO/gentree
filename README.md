(markdown || program) to tree.

```
├── There are three ways to generate tree (CLI, Package(1), Package(2)). They are explained below.
├── CLI and Package(1)
│   ├── Given a Markdown file or format, the result of linux tree command is printed.
│   ├── Create Markdown file by referring to the file in the `testdata/` directory.
│   │   ├── Hierarchy is represented by hyphen and indentation.
│   │   └── Indentation should be unified by one of the following.
│   │       ├── Tab (default)
│   │       ├── Two spaces (required: `-ts`)
│   │       └── Four spaces (required: `-fs`)
│   └── You can also output JSON (required: `-j`)
├── Package(1)
│   └── You can customize branch format.
└── Package(2)
    ├── You can also generate a tree programmatically.
    ├── Markdown is irrelevant.
    ├── You can customize branch format.
    └── You can also output JSON.
